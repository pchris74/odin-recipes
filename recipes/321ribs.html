    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>321 ribs are a foolproof way to get fall-off-the-bone ribs. The 321 rib method is based on smoking the ribs for 3 hours, wrapping them with liquid for 2 hours, and saucing them for the final 1 hour.</p>
    <p>Smoking ribs using the 321 method is one of the most popular ways for a backyard enthusiast to cook ribs. They result in a truly delectable, fall-off-the-bone rib. While many “BBQ purists” will balk at the 321 method, there’s no denying that this meat is juicy, tender, and delicious. So, if you or your guests like meat that comes clean off the bone with every bite, definitely give the 321 rib method a try!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack of baby back ribs</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider (or apple juice)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons salted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat.</strong> Fire up the grill and preheat to 180-200 degrees F. Prepare the ribs for smoking while the grill preheats.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep the ribs.</strong> Using a paper towel, grip the corner of the membrane on the back of the ribs, and pull to remove it. Next, season both sides of the ribs liberally with Sweet Rub or Rib Rub.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoke for 3 hours.</strong> Start with exposing the seasoned ribs to 3 hours of heavy smoke over low heat. I prefer fruit woods (apple or cherry) when smoking pork, but other hardwoods (hickory and alder) also work really well with ribs.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap for 2 hours.</strong> After the initial 3-hour smoke, foil the ribs with a liquid of your choosing (I used apple cider, dark brown sugar, and butter) and cook at 225-250 degrees F for 2 more hours. After the braising period, Iook for great retraction of the meat from the bones. You want the bones to be exposed on the end at least 1/4 to 1/2 an inch.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce and smoke for 1 hour.</strong> Lastly, baste the ribs in your favorite BBQ sauce (my Everything BBQ Sauce or Apple Jalapeno BBQ Sauce are delicious!)  and return them to the grill for a final hour to finish the ribs and set the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and enjoy.</strong> Remove the ribs from the smoker and rest for 10-15 minutes. Slice into individual ribs and serve! I like to put extra sauce on the table for guests who enjoy their ribs extra saucy.</li>

    </ol>
